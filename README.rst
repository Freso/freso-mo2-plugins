The project is still in its very early stages. Feel free to submit PRs,
but please adhere to code style and respect that not all the project
goals have been fully fleshed out yet, so your patch may not be in line
with the author's vision.

Code style
^^^^^^^^^^

The plugins will have a strict adherence to PEP8_, with the exception of
the line length. It is nice to stay under the 72/79 characters per line,
but not an absolute necessity.

Commits going into the master branch should strive to be
